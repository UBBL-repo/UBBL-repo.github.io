    <h2>Ultrasound Imaging of Macrophages</h2>
    <p>
Imaging of immune cells and especially macrophage trafficking can reveal important molecular, cellular, and functional characteristics of the host tissue and support the discovery of new biomarkers for improved diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring. Over the past years, macrophage imaging using different modalities has undergone significant development, however existing modalities can only detect a relatively large number of macrophages at high penetration depths. Although ultrasound (US) could potentially address this challenge, while also providing portable assessment (e.g., in an outpatient setting) at potentially lower costs, there is a paucity of investigations using ultrasound for macrophage imaging.

Our lab develops a method to track macrophages at high spatiotemporal resolution deep into tissue with ultrasound imaging.  We tag macrophages with microbubble ultrasound contrast agents, enabling us to visualize them deep within tissues using linear and nonlinear ultrasound imaging. This allows us to monitor how these cells move through the body and accumulate in tumors without compromising their viability or function. Unlike traditional imaging methods, this ultrasound-based approach combines high sensitivity (i.e., it approaches the theoretical limit of one cell), high resolution, extended penetration depth, and safety. It is also compatible with wearable ultrasound devices that create new possibilities for imaging macrophage trafficking in solid tumors over long periods of time. Our lab employes several methods to characterize the effect of labeling on macrophages activity‚Äîincluding migration assays, flow cytometry, and ELISA ‚Äì to ensure that macrophages normal function is not impaired.

The concept of injectable, engineered cell-based, active, diagnostics is in striking contrast with current, passive, diagnostic modalities, which rely on uptake by the host‚Äôs cells of intravenously administered small molecule agents that lack the ability to overcome biological barriers and navigate through tissues, thereby providing a paradigm shift in disease diagnosis. 
    </p>
This research also opens doors to immediate clinical applications for therapy. For instance, the method can directly guide image-based delivery of cell therapies into tumors, such as chimeric antigen receptor macrophages. It also has promising potential for precision drug delivery, where macrophages could carry therapeutic agents to tumors and release them on demand via ultrasound. Additionally, the technique may help assess tumor aggressiveness, detect micrometastases, and support novel microsurgical interventions. We continue to improve this technology by optimizing the imaging pipeline, from fine-tuning ultrasound acquisition pulse sequences and algorithms to image post-processing and registration, including cross-confirmation of our observation with other imaging modalities.

        <p>
 Our research lays the groundwork towards the development and translation to the clinics of this novel approach for macrophage imaging and tracking using ultrasound offering accessible, scalable, and cost-effective methods for imaging immune cell trafficking. See this paper for more information about our work on ultrasound imaging of macrophage trafficking and accumulation in solid tumors.
