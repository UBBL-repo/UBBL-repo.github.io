    <h2>Microbubble dynamics: modeling, monitoring, and control</h2>
    <p>
Microbubble-enhanced focused ultrasound (MB-FUS) has emerged as a powerful method to transiently and noninvasively increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), enabling the delivery of therapeutics to the central nervous system. At the core of this approach lies the ability to precisely control the acoustic behavior of microbubbles within the brain vasculature. The therapeutic efficacy and safety of MB-FUS hinge on the type and strength of microbubble oscillations—ranging from stable cavitation to inertial collapse—each eliciting distinct biological effects.
    </p>
    <p>
However, microbubble dynamics are inherently nonlinear and highly sensitive to variations in ultrasound parameters, microbubble properties, local concentration, and vascular microenvironmental conditions. These variables can fluctuate rapidly during treatment, making it challenging to maintain the desired oscillation regime.
    </p>
    <p>
To address this, our lab develops real-time closed-loop control systems that monitor microbubble acoustic emissions (AEs) and adapt ultrasound exposure dynamically to promote stable oscillations while avoiding collapse. These controllers use spectral features of AEs to infer the oscillation regime and adjust the applied acoustic pressure accordingly. Unlike open-loop approaches, our closed-loop systems are responsive to transient changes in microbubble concentration and vascular interactions, enabling safe and repeatable BBB opening across sessions.

    <h2>Ultrasound frequency control of microbubble dynamics</h2>
    <p>
Microbubble (MB) oscillations under focused ultrasound (FUS) are key to inducing mechanical stress in brain vasculature, enabling transient blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening and facilitating drug delivery. Traditionally, MB acoustic emission strength—captured through harmonics and ultraharmonics—has been used as a real-time feedback marker to adjust ultrasound amplitude and ensure treatment safety and efficacy. While amplitude-based closed-loop systems have proven effective in modulating BBB permeability, they offer limited ability to differentially tune the diverse biological responses triggered by MBs, resulting in a narrow therapeutic window.</p>
    <p>
Emerging research highlights that ultrasound frequency, not just amplitude, plays a crucial role in controlling MB behavior due to resonance effects that depend on MB size, shell properties, and the surrounding microenvironment. By tuning the excitation frequency, it is possible to achieve different oscillation regimes, fluid microstreaming patterns, and vessel wall interactions—each capable of eliciting distinct mechanical and biological responses. However, due to the complexity of MB dynamics in vivo and the limited ability to observe MB-vessel interactions directly, the principles for frequency-based control remain underexplored.</p>
    <p>
Our lab integrates high-fidelity modeling and in vivo experimentation to investigate how MB resonance can be harnessed through frequency modulation. This approach aims to refine our understanding of frequency-dependent mechanical stress and its impact on BBB signaling and function, ultimately advancing the design of ultrasound protocols for safe and selective neuromodulation and therapeutic delivery.</p>

    <h2>Acoustic Holography</h2>
    <p>
Transcranial ultrasound (TUS) is a disruptive technology with the potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases by enabling: i) reversible opening of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), ii) modulation of neuronal function, and iii) irreversible silencing of neuronal activity. As this technology matures, developing simpler and more economical systems that still meet the stringent targeting requirements of TUS neuro-interventions is critical to realizing its full potential.</p>
    <p>
Our team has advanced the use of 3D-printed acoustic holograms, which are uniquely suited for creating high-performance and cost-effective TUS systems. We have introduced a novel framework for transcranial acoustic hologram design, based on the Heterogeneous Angular Spectrum Approach (a fast frequency-domain method) combined with automatic differentiation, to efficiently optimize the topology of 3D-printed lenses. When attached to a single transducer, these lenses can generate complex pressure fields through the human skull to facilitate patient-specific and high-accuracy neuro-interventions.</p>

    <h2>Nonlinear Acoustics and the Parametric Array Effect</h2>
    <p>
The parametric array effect is a nonlinear wave phenomenon that occurs when two high-frequency ultrasound beams of finite amplitude interact, generating secondary beams at their sum and difference frequencies. The difference-frequency signal, known as the parametric array signal, has unique properties: it is highly directional, can penetrate the skull, and its strength depends on the medium’s nonlinearity, the square of the primary amplitude, and the propagation length.</p>
    <p>
Our team recently discovered that the parametric signal is not only amplified by the skull but also highly sensitive to skull-induced aberrations. We further demonstrated its potential as a real-time feedback mechanism for noninvasively aligning holographic lenses to the patient’s skull. Beyond skull-compensating lens registration, this feedback may also enable noninvasive aberration correction in phased arrays, providing a way to optimize the phase and amplitude of each element directly in vivo.</p>
