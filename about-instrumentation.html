      We engineer ultrasound instrumentation tailored for precise brain applications. Our team builds acoustic holograms, phased arrays, and control electronics to shape pressure fields through the skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a combination of 3D printing, hydrophone mapping, and simulation tools, we iteratively optimize transducers and control circuits to support focused ultrasound therapy and imaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      These tools are used in conjunction with machine learning-based controllers and real-time feedback mechanisms to deliver personalized and adaptive treatments.
