    <p>
      Our lab is developing a new method for imaging and tracking single cells within the body using ultrasound.
      We achieve this by labeling cells with lipid-shell microbubbles, which act as strong acoustic contrast agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      We focus on macrophages due to their key role in diseases like cancer and atherosclerosis. These immune cells
      can phagocytose microbubbles and remain active, enabling real-time ultrasound tracking during immune activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weâ€™ve validated our method using migration assays, flow cytometry, ELISA, and in vivo models. To enhance image quality,
      we refine acquisition sequences, algorithms, and registration pipelinesâ€”cross-confirmed with other imaging modalities.
