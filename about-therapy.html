    <h2>Blood-brain barrier opening with microbubble-enhanced focused ultrasound</h2>
    <p>
The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a tightly regulated neurovascular interface that restricts the entry of most blood-borne therapeutics into the brain. Microbubble-enhanced focused ultrasound (MB-FUS) offers a physical and noninvasive method to transiently increase BBB permeability by harnessing the mechanical effects of circulating microbubbles (MBs) exposed to ultrasound (US).</p>
    <p>
These effects collectively increase the permeability of the BBB, facilitating the delivery and penetration of a variety of therapeutic agents, including small molecules, antibodies, nucleic acids, and cellular therapies.</p>
    <p>
Our lab integrates such focused ultrasound methodology to treat brain cancers by enhancing delivery of molecules ranging from antibodies, siRNA, and CART cell therapies.

    <h2>Closed-loop sonothermal activation and control of therapeutics</h2>
    <p>
Our lab is developing novel closed-loop feedback systems that employ real-time MR temperature imaging for transcranial focused ultrasound-mediated hyperthermia. We apply this technology to control advanced cell therapies with high spatiotemporal control. Our recent investigation revealed that mild heating can repeatedly activate engineered immune cells inside the brain and support metronomic immunotherapy. This metronomic sonothermogenetic control helps the immune cells to overcome aggressive brain tumors, such as glioblastoma and breast cancer brain metastasis, heterogenous antigen expression and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment while minimizing off-target toxicity. See this preprint for more information about our work on sonothermogenetic control of brain cancer immunotherapy. <p>
Earlier work from our lab has used this technology to remotely modulate the brain tumor microenvironment and trigger the release of chemotherapy from temperature-sensitive nanotherapeutics. See this paper for more information about our work on sonothermal activation and control of anticancer agents. 
We are currently working towards translating these novel technologies that aim to overcome some of the most significant barriers to the treatment of brain cancer.
